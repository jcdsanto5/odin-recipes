HTML project via TOP

Last Updated: March 9th/23

The beginning of my journey towards a web developer all self-taught from "The Odin Project" supplemented by courses from "BCIT"'s program of Web Technology Certificate.

This is a project of creating a recipe through HTML.


Added the structure of the main website with adding links to the dishes webpage represented.
